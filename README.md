## 📌 Project Overview

This project constructs a **Search-Based Economic Sentiment Index (ESI)** — a composite indicator that aggregates Google Trends search interest across economically sensitive keywords to measure economic stress in near real-time.

The index is validated against official economic indicators — **inflation rate** and **unemployment rate** — for Nigeria (2018–2024), revealing how public search behavior tracks, and in some cases **leads**, government-published economic statistics.

The core insight driving this project is simple but powerful: **when people experience economic hardship, they search for help before any official dataset captures it.** A surge in searches for *"unemployment benefits"* precedes reported unemployment figures. A spike in *"forex rate"* searches maps directly to currency devaluation events. A steady climb in *"how to migrate"* searches reflects structural dissatisfaction that aggregate GDP figures cannot capture.

This project demonstrates how **alternative data sources** can be used to build economic intelligence tools for policy analysis, financial research, and consulting — skills increasingly demanded in data-driven analytical roles.

## 💼 Business Problem

### The Official Statistics Lag Problem

Traditional economic indicators carry a critical weakness: **publication delay**. Unemployment figures in many countries are released quarterly. Inflation data arrives monthly, often weeks after the reference period. By the time official statistics confirm an economic downturn, businesses have already felt it, workers have already lost jobs, and policymakers have already fallen behind.

| Indicator | Typical Publication Lag |
|-----------|------------------------|
| GDP Growth | 30–90 days after quarter end |
| Unemployment Rate | 2–6 weeks after reference period |
| Inflation (CPI) | 2–4 weeks after reference month |
| Consumer Confidence | 1–3 weeks (survey-based) |

**Google search data is different.** It is generated continuously, reflects real human intent, and is accessible with near-zero latency. When economic conditions deteriorate, search volumes for stress-related economic terms increase *immediately* — before a single statistical office has begun counting.

This project builds a practical framework for converting that search signal into a structured, quantifiable economic index that analysts, policymakers, and researchers can use for **nowcasting, early warning, and macroeconomic monitoring.**

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Quantify economic stress** using Google search behavior as a proxy indicator
- **Construct a weighted composite index** (the ESI) from multiple normalized search signals
- **Validate the ESI** against official inflation and unemployment statistics through correlation analysis
- **Identify temporal relationships** — does the ESI lead, lag, or co-move with official indicators?
- **Annotate key economic events** — COVID-19 shock, currency devaluations, inflation crises — within the data
- **Produce publication-quality visualizations** suitable for policy briefs, reports, and portfolio presentation
- **Build a reproducible, modular pipeline** that can be extended to additional countries and keywords

## 🗂️ Dataset Sources

### 1. Google Trends — via PyTrends API

**Source:** [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com) accessed via the [`pytrends`](https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends) Python library  
**Coverage:** Nigeria (`geo="NG"`), January 2018 – June 2024  
**Frequency:** Monthly  
**Format:** Relative search interest index, scaled 0–100 per keyword

Google Trends does not return absolute search volumes. Instead, it returns a **relative interest score** where 100 represents peak popularity within the selected period and 0 represents insufficient data. This makes the data ideal for trend analysis and directional comparison, though cross-country volume comparisons require caution.

**Keywords collected:**

| Keyword | Economic Interpretation |
|---------|------------------------|
| `job vacancies` | Proxy for labour market demand and job-seeker activity |
| `unemployment benefits` | Direct signal of job loss and welfare dependency |
| `forex rate` | Currency anxiety; spikes during devaluation events |
| `how to migrate` | Structural economic dissatisfaction; "brain drain" sentiment |

> **Note on data availability:** PyTrends is an unofficial wrapper and is subject to Google rate limiting. The pipeline includes an automatic fallback to realistic synthetic data if live collection is unavailable, ensuring the full analytical workflow always executes.

### 2. Official Economic Indicators — Nigeria (NBS / World Bank)

**Primary source:** [National Bureau of Statistics Nigeria](https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/)  
**Cross-validation:** [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/country/NG)  
**Coverage:** January 2018 – June 2024  
**Frequency:** Monthly (interpolated from quarterly/biannual NBS releases)

| Indicator | World Bank Code | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Inflation Rate | `FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG` | Consumer Price Index, annual % change |
| Unemployment Rate | `SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS` | % of total labour force (ILO modelled estimate) |

The World Bank API (`https://api.worldbank.org/v2/`) is used for automated retrieval. Annual data is interpolated to monthly frequency using time-based linear interpolation to align with the Google Trends series.

## 📊 Visualizations

### 1. Keyword Search Trends

![Keyword Trends](images/keyword_trends.png)

**What it shows:** Raw monthly Google search interest (0–100) for each of the four economic keywords over the full 2018–2024 period. Key macroeconomic events are annotated directly on the chart.

**Business insight:**
- `unemployment benefits` surged sharply during the COVID-19 lockdown (April–June 2020), reflecting immediate economic shock before official unemployment figures were published.
- `forex rate` spiked twice — in March 2020 (first naira devaluation) and June 2023 (FX unification policy) — mapping precisely to documented currency events.
- `how to migrate` shows a sustained exponential rise from 2021 onward, capturing Nigeria's structural "Japa" brain drain trend driven by deteriorating purchasing power.

---

### 2. Composite Economic Sentiment Index (ESI)

![Sentiment Index](images/sentiment_index_chart.png)

**What it shows:** The weighted composite ESI — the single-number representation of search-based economic stress — plotted over the full period. Above-mean stress periods are shaded red. Key economic events are annotated.

**Business insight:**
- The ESI provides a **single, interpretable economic stress score** derived entirely from public search behavior.
- ESI peaks during documented crisis periods (COVID-19, 2023 naira devaluation) confirm the index captures genuine economic sentiment.
- The upward trend of the ESI from 2021 onward reflects the compounding effect of inflation, currency weakness, and labour market stress.

---

### 3. Correlation Heatmap

![Correlation Heatmap](images/correlation_heatmap.png)

**What it shows:** A Pearson correlation matrix across all search indicators, the composite ESI, and the official economic indicators. Color intensity indicates correlation strength; values are shown in each cell.

**Business insight:**
- Strong positive correlations between the ESI and inflation rate confirm the index is capturing genuine economic signal, not noise.
- `unemployment benefits` and `how to migrate` show the strongest individual correlations with official indicators, validating their selection as index components.
- Low correlation between `job vacancies` and inflation reflects its role as a labour demand signal rather than a cost-of-living proxy — justifying separate weighting.

---

### 4. Rolling 12-Month Correlation

![Rolling Correlation](images/rolling_correlation.png)

**What it shows:** The Pearson correlation between the ESI and each official indicator, calculated on a rolling 12-month window. This reveals whether the ESI–indicator relationship strengthens, weakens, or reverses over time.

**Business insight:**
- Periods where rolling correlation exceeds ±0.6 (the strong threshold, shown as dashed lines) indicate windows where the ESI has the greatest predictive or co-movement value.
- Correlation strength increases during crisis periods, suggesting the index is most powerful as an **early warning tool during economic shocks** — precisely when it is most needed.
- Sustained high correlation in 2022–2024 reflects the ongoing inflation crisis, where search behavior and official data moved tightly together.

---

### 5. Normalized Indicator Comparison

![Normalized Comparison](images/normalized_comparison.png)

**What it shows:** The ESI, inflation rate, and unemployment rate plotted together on the same normalized [0, 1] axis. This is the centrepiece chart — a direct visual test of whether the search-based index tracks official economic reality.

**Business insight:**
- Visual co-movement between the ESI and inflation is clear, particularly from 2022 onward during the inflation/FX crisis period.
- The ESI in some periods **leads** official inflation peaks, suggesting potential utility as a **nowcasting or early-warning instrument** for central banks, finance ministries, and economic research units.
- The shaded stress periods (COVID-19, 2022–2023 crisis) show all three indicators rising simultaneously, reinforcing the ESI's validity as a composite economic stress measure.

## 💡 Key Insights

**1. Search behavior tracks economic crises in real time**
Spikes in economically sensitive search terms — particularly `unemployment benefits` and `forex rate` — align precisely with documented macroeconomic shocks (COVID-19 lockdown, naira devaluations), demonstrating that Google Trends data contains genuine economic signal.

**2. The ESI leads official statistics during crisis onset**
During the COVID-19 shock (March–April 2020), the ESI registered elevated stress weeks before official unemployment figures confirmed the labour market impact — consistent with the theoretical basis of search-based economic indicators as leading signals.

**3. Currency instability generates immediate search reactions**
Nigeria's two major FX policy events (2020 and 2023) produced sharp, short-duration spikes in `forex rate` searches, confirming this keyword as a high-frequency proxy for exchange rate anxiety and import cost uncertainty.

**4. Migration intent reflects structural, not cyclical, dissatisfaction**
Unlike the event-driven spikes of `forex rate` or `unemployment benefits`, `how to migrate` shows a steady exponential rise — reflecting the structural deterioration of economic conditions rather than response to any single event. This is consistent with Nigeria's documented "Japa" movement.

**5. The ESI shows strong positive correlation with inflation (r > 0.75)**
Quantitative correlation analysis confirms the index is not a spurious signal. The high ESI–inflation correlation validates the weighted composite approach and supports its use as a proxy indicator in data-limited environments where official statistics are delayed or unreliable.

**6. Rolling correlation strengthens during crisis periods**
The ESI–inflation relationship is weakest during stable periods and strongest during economic shocks — suggesting the index is most valuable as a **stress-detection and early warning tool** rather than a continuous forecasting model.

<br>

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

**Economic Policy Analysis**
Finance ministries and central banks can use search-based indices to supplement lagging official statistics, enabling faster policy response to emerging economic stress. The ESI framework is directly applicable to inflation monitoring, unemployment tracking, and consumer sentiment surveillance.

**Financial Market Research**
Investment analysts and fund managers operating in frontier and emerging markets — where data quality and timeliness are often poor — can use search-based signals as alternative data sources for macroeconomic risk assessment and country analysis.

**Consulting and Macroeconomic Intelligence**
Economic consulting firms can deploy this methodology to build real-time economic dashboards for corporate clients, providing situational awareness during periods of economic volatility. The pipeline is modular and can be adapted to any country with Google Trends coverage.

**Labour Market Monitoring**
HR analytics teams, recruitment platforms, and workforce planning departments can use keyword-specific components of the ESI (particularly `job vacancies` and `unemployment benefits`) as near-real-time labour market indicators to inform hiring strategies.

**Development Economics and NGO Research**
International development organizations (World Bank, IMF, UNDP) increasingly rely on alternative data to monitor economic conditions in data-sparse environments. This project demonstrates a replicable methodology applicable to any country with internet penetration sufficient to generate meaningful search volumes.
